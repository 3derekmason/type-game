            Welcome to &quot;type game&quot; â€“ a fun and addictive game that
            challenges your typing skills! In this game, you&apos;ll be given a
            random phrase to type with the goal to type it as fast and
            accurately as you can. The game tracks your time and type count for
            each completed phrase, allowing you to measure and share progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the optional sign-in feature, you can also track and share your
            own high scores with friends and other players. Built with
            TypeScript, Next.js, and MongoDB, &quot;type game&quot; is fast,
            responsive, and easy to use.
